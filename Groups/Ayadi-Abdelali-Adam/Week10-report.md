### What I could achieve

- Coded first page of the game, the page is sort of gateway to the game, normally it should have stuff like best score and last attempt score. But we won't have them for the moment.
- The interesting i did was that **I changed the background of [the window](#img) to an image**, I this by making first the background using canva, then i exported it to a string encoded in base64, and then I passed it as a Form in the `background:` method. The way we bind symboles to icons got me inspired.
- One other thing I did was messing with BlLayouts to have the perfect front-end look.

### What I couldn't achieve

- Change the color of the text to the one I want. I could only have the background image.
