#### Mutate your tests

I run mutation testing on the project and find 24% of mutants were killed. And for the code coverage for the package **Myg-Chess-Core** only 14.63% of code covered and for the package **Myg-Chess-Importer** 53.02% of code covered.

We can understand that from the mutation testing, that indicate weak test effectiveness and that we need to increase test coverage.
Our result is understandable because we are only at the beginning of our project we need still need to review the existing code and correct the code and write tests.
