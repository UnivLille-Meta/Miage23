# Maureen's section

## Exercices
I try the exercise about mutation testing : https://github.com/maureencfr/C3P/blob/main/src/MutationTestingPractice.md

## Mutate your tests

I ran mutation testing on my tests and on the tests that are already in the project. Only 33% of mutants are killed and 46% of code covered. It's not a surprise when we watch the test package because it's almost empty.
I don't finished the tests for the targetSquaresLegal method and most of the surviving mutants are in this method, so I know that I have to pay more attention to these tests.

## Prepare

I read the slides and don't have questions about it.
I start my kata to Chess project by adding a boolean for the first move of the pawn, I changed the targetLegalSquares method and began to write tests for it.

I also began the fun mooc linked to this course.
