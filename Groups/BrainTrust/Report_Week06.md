Lynda AGOUAZI

During this week, I accomplished the following tasks
- I learned with the teaher’s explanation about printString, printOn, NullObject, hooks & sending messages.
- I improved my linked list implementation by adding a test to check its size.
- I successfully installed blocs using the Metacello script.
- I watched a video about blocs for Pharo “Bloc for Pharo: Current State and Future Perspective”. I followed the instructions, and created a dynamic space with different shapes (boxes and circles), animations, and features. I also played around with layouts and other parts, and I had a great time doing it.
- I installed the Myg framework and played games, with Sokoban being a favorite. Some game levels were challenging (Like UAlberta) , but I managed to win.
- I picked a game called "samegame" to work on with my teammate and began planning its design and components.

Challenges I Encountered:
- At first, I was scared about how I can understand blocs because I thought it would be very difficult. But after following the instructions in the git repository 
and watching the video about blocs in Pharo, I gained a much better understanding.

Pending Tasks:
- I couldn't start implementing the "samegame" project because I ran out of time. So far, I've only created the board and some circles.
