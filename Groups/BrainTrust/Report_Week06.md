During this week:
- I learned about the NullObject, hooks, and template.
- I improved my linked list implementation by adding more tests.
- I installed Blocs, the Myg framework, and played games, with Sokoban being a favorite.
- I watched the video “Bloc for Pharo: Current State and Future Perspective” and created a dynamic space with different shapes, animations, and features. I also played around with layouts and other parts, I had a great time doing it!
- I picked a game called "samegame" to work on with my teammate and began planning its design and components.

Challenges I Encountered:
- Designing the game was a bit hard in the beginning.
