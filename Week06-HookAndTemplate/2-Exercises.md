# Exercises 

To practice the hook and template we reviewed today, here are some exercises you can work on:

- look in the chess game for template methods. How can you identify them? Hint: check the class hierarchies, template method exploits the inheritance chain

- Can you identify code where you can use template methods?
  - if you find one, refactor it to use a template method.
  - **To think about:** How do you *know* that you can change existing code into a template method? what is the procedure to do it?
  - if you don't find one, can you invent one?
