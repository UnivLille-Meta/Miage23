## Course Contract

This course proposes a series of teorical lectures and practical exercises.
Modules are divided in weeks, each in a different folder, and you will find the theory and practice in that folder.
To pass this course you will need to:
 - pass the exams (see [Calendar.md](Calendar.md))
 - make a presentation (see [Calendar.md](Calendar.md))
 - do at minimum **all** the homework in the exercises (file Exercises.md in each folder)
	=> Each week will feature mini quizzes about the homework of the past week
 - write (short) weekly reports to tell us your activity. Remember, focus on the important things, and show us that you are learning.

### Make a group

Some of the activities during the course require group organization.
For example, this is the case for reporting and presentations.

Make your groups and create a folder inside the [Groups](Groups) directory.
Choose a name for your group and use that as folder name.
Put inside your group folder
 - a file with your full names and emails
 - all your activity and reports
 
make recurrent pull requests to update it.

For example, imagine that Jeanne D'arc and Tintin LeBelge are together in a group called RevolutionX.
They create a directory RevolutionX

> Groups
>   - RevolutionX
>      members.md (names and emails)
>      report-week01.md (one section for Jeanne, one for Tintin)
>      report-week02.md (one section for Jeanne, one for Tintin)


## FAQ

### Solving SSH problems in Git/Github

Make sure you have correct configured you authentication setup
- If you want to use SSH authentication
    - set up your SSH keys with a recent encryption, check github's instructions
- upload your public keys to github
    - If you want to use HTTPS authentication (or not do the SSH setup)
    - change Icebergs setting, "Metacello Integration" with the value HTTPS

	- create an access token to be able to push (and make sure of giving it permissions by ticking the check boxes)
