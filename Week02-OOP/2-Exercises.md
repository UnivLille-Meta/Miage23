# Exercises 

To practice the OOP concepts we reviewed today, here are some exercises you can work on:

- Think about how to implement the boolean methods `|`, `or:`, `ifTrue:ifFalse:`. Write them down. Try to make your pseudo-code be syntactically valid please. **Tip:** remember that to defer execution of code for the lazy version you can use block closures (i.e., `[ ... ]`), which are lambda expressions. To evaluate a lambda expression you can use the message `value` and its variants with arguments: `value:`, `value:value:` and so on...

- Do a pass on the lookup exercises from the slides. Do you get the correct result? Do you understand why? Try arriving until the cases with `super` sends.

- Think about what does `self == super` return. Remember that `==` is the identity comparison, returning true if the compared objects are *the same* object
