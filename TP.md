# Enter Chess

This year's practice will revolve around a chess game implementation available in https://github.com/UnivLille-Meta/Chess/
The repository contains the code, dependencies and a list of **katas**.

Chess rules can be find online.
Check for example the videos and explanations in chess.com (https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess) or wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess).
Do not hesitate to look online for other resources.

Note that you don't need to be a chess grand master, or to know how to play to implement a chess game :).

## Your tasks

In groups, you have to choose different katas to solve.
Katas are tagged with **Goals**, specifying what you are going to practice/learn with that kata.

- Each group has to solve one kata per person. You are free to organize as you want. For example, you can divide each kata in subtasks, and treat all katas simultaneously, or treat katas one by one.
- You need to choose *at least* one refactoring kata per group.

## Project Guidelines (Mise en forme du rendu)

At the end of the semester you need to deliver:

### Make your project available for us

- **Mandatory: give us read access to your code**
   - Add a `Readme.md` file in your group's directory, next to where you put your weekly repports.
   - Add in your `Readme.md` file the link to your repository.
   - Make sure your repository is public so we can see it
 
- **Optional: give us write access to your code**
   - Share your repository with us the teachers, so we will have write access to your code
 
### Prepare your repository instructions

Add in your repository a `Readme.md` file with the following information:
- Installation instructions: what should we download to run your project? in what order? Please test these installation instructions and make sure everything works
- Usage instructions: What should we do to run your project? How do we use it? How do we interact with it?
- Where is your code/tests located? Should we take care of something?

Explain the basics:
 - what katas you did
 - what difficulties you encountered and how you solved them
 - how well is your code tested and how did you do it. Automated testing, mutation testing, manual testing?

Add an extra section with **Design decisions**. Use this section to explain things that are not visible in the code:
- Why is the code like this?
- Why is this part of the code more tested than the other?
- Where did you put the priorities?
- Where did you use (or not) design patterns in the code and why?
- ...

### What we are going to look

We are going to look in your project, in different levels:

1. First level: functional -- le minimum syndical
    - Does it install?
    - Does it run?
    - Are there tests?
    - Are the tests green?

2. Second level: code quality
    - Is the code readable?
    - Did you design your test cases?
    - How did you use the tools that were at your disposal? Myg, Bloc, Test framework...
    - How did you apply the concepts we saw in class? Design patterns, inheritance, delegation, polymorphism...

3. Cross-cutting -- soft skills:
    - Asking for help and questions in mailing lists/discord/discussion channels
    - Answering in mailing lists/discord/discussion channels
    - Opening entries in issue/bug trackers
