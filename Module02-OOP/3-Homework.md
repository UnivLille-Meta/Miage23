For next week's lecture, you need to do the following tasks and prepare a short report on how you approached them. Each of the following tasks will guide your work with questions. You must answer those questions in the report.

### Practice message dispatch

Write small code examples challenging your knowledge about dispatch.
Did the examples work as expected? What was different between what you expected and what you saw in reality?

Share your programs in the report with the answer to those questions.
